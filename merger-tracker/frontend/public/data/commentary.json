EMIS's core product is a primary care electronic patient record (EPR) system. The ACCC determined the acquisition did not require notification because:\n\n- there is very limited horizontal overlap in Australia between TPG's portfolio companies (Nextech supplies specialty-specific software to dermatology/plastic surgery clinics, while Covetrus supplies software to veterinary practices) and EMIS;\n- EMIS' Australian activities are limited to maintenance services for a single customer with a legacy EPR system; and\n- alternative suppliers of EPR systems and healthcare software remain in Australia.\n\nWhile notification thresholds were likely met, the ACCC waived the requirement given its view that there were minimal competition concerns.",
