In doing so, the ACCC must have\nregard to the object of the Act and all relevant matters, including the\ninterests of consumers.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotified acquisitions, see the ACCC\u2019s merger assessment guidelines\nand interim merger process guidelines.\nIn conducting its competition assessment, the ACCC has considered\nthe information and documents that were submitted with the\nnotification form and information from third partes.\nThe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition may be put into\neffect as it considers that the Acquisition is unlikely to have the\neffect of substantially lessening competition in any market in\nAustralia. In reaching its decision, and based on the material before\nit, the ACCC makes the following findings:\n\u2022 the Parties\u2019 market share aggregation is estimated to be low\n\u2022 the Parties do not appear to be close competitors in the supply\nof critical communications\n\u2022 the Parties would likely continue to be constrained by alternative\nsuppliers of critical communications in Australia, including\nTelstra, Motorola Solutions and Nokia."
