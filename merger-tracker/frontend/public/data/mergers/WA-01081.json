          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided with the notification waiver application and had\nregard to the factors in section 51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition and\nConsumer Act 2010 (Cth) (Act), being:\n(i) the object of the Act,\n(ii) the interests of consumers,\n(iii) the likelihood that, if the acquisition were put into effect,\nthe notification thresholds in section 51ABP(1) of the Act\nwould apply, and\n(iv) the likelihood that the acquisition, if put into effect, would\nin all the circumstances have the effect, or be likely to\nhave the effect, of substantially lessening competition in\nany market.\nBased on the information provided in the application, the ACCC\nconsiders that the Acquisition is unlikely to give rise to any material\nlessening of competition. In particular:\na. Faculty Science has limited operations and presence in\nAustralia.\nb. There is a small horizontal overlap between Accenture and\nFaculty Science in the supply of application implementation\nservices and technology consulting services in Australia.\nc. The parties\u2019 combined market share in the broader supply of\napplication implementation and technology consulting\nservices in Australia is low with alternative suppliers\nexpected to constrain the merged firm.\nd. There is a low risk of concerning conglomerate effects\nresulting from bundling or tying of products post-merger.\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply.\nWhile the ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely\nto be met, given that material competition concerns are unlikely to\narise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required to\nbe notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition effects\nmore generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on notification\nwaivers and merger assessment guidelines."
