          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided with the notification waiver application and had\nregard to the factors in section 51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition and\nConsumer Act 2010 (Cth) (Act).\nBased on the information provided in the application, the ACCC\nconsiders that the Acquisition is unlikely to give rise to any material\nlessening of competition. In particular:\na. There is no horizontal overlap in Australia between the\nproducts and services supplied by the parties, and there are\nno vertical relationships.\nb. Evac has a small presence in Australia.\nGiven that the ACCC considers that material competition concerns\nare unlikely to arise, it is not necessary to reach a concluded view on\nthe likelihood of the notification thresholds being met.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition effects\nmore generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on notification\nwaivers and merger assessment guidelines."
