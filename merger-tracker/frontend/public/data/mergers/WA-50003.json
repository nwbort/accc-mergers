          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided with the notification waiver application and\ncertain publicly available information, and had regard to the factors\nin section 51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010\n(Cth) (Act).\nBased on the information currently before it, the ACCC considers that\nthe Acquisition is unlikely to give rise to any material lessening of\ncompetition. In particular:\na. there is no horizontal overlap between Francisco Partners\nand Sermo in the supply of social networking or platform\nservices for healthcare professionals in Australia, and there\nare no vertical relationships in this respect\nb. while there may be a small horizontal or complementary\nrelationship between the healthcare market research, data\nand analytics services provided by Sermo and Merative,\nthere are numerous alternative suppliers of these services in\nAustralia\nc. Sermo has a small presence in Australia.\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply.\nWhile the ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely\nto be met, given the above consideration that material competition\nconcerns are unlikely to arise, the ACCC has determined that the\nAcquisition is not required to be notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
