          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided with the notification waiver application, public\ninformation and other industry information held by the ACCC, and\nhad regard to the factors in section 51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition\nand Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (Act).\nBased on the information outlined above, the ACCC considers that\nthe Acquisition is unlikely to give rise to any material lessening of\ncompetition. In particular:\na. StrongDM has a very small presence in Australia.\nb. There are numerous alternative suppliers of IAM or PAM\nsoftware in Australia and globally.\nc. While there is horizontal overlap between the software\nsupplied by Delinea and StrongDM, the increase in share of\nsupply in Australia arising from the Acquisition would be\nvery small.\nd. Apart from Delinea, no horizontal overlap has been identified\nbetween any of TPG\u2019s other connected entities and\nStrongDM.\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply.\nWhile the ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely\nto be met, given that material competition concerns are unlikely to\narise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required\nto be notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
