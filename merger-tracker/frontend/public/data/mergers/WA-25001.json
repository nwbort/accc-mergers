          "item": "Explanation for\ndetermination",
          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided by the applicant, including in the notification\nwaiver application, and had regard to the factors in section 51ABV(2)\nof the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (Act).\nBased on the information provided by the applicant, the ACCC\nconsiders that the Acquisition is unlikely to give rise to any material\nlessening of competition. In particular:\na. There is no horizontal overlap between Regent Motors Group\nand Esperance Motor Group in the supply of new and used\nmotor vehicles and after sale services in Esperance and the\nsurrounding areas.\nb. There is a potential horizontal overlap between Regent\nMotors Group and Esperance Motor Group in the broader\narea of southern WA. If Perth is excluded from this area,\nthere are independent alternatives in Albany, Kalgoorlie,\nKatanning and Narrogin. If Perth is included in this area, the\nmerged parties would likely face competition from\nnumerous additional alternative dealerships in Perth.\nc. Any increment to Regent Motors Group share of the supply\nof Toyota and Ford vehicles in Western Australia is small.\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply.\nWhile the ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely\nto be met, given that material competition concerns are unlikely to\narise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required\nto be notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
