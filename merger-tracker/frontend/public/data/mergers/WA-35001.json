          "item": "Explanation for\ndetermination",
          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided with the notification waiver application and had\nregard to the factors in section 51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition and\nConsumer Act 2010 (Cth) (Act), being:\n(i) the object of the Act,\n(ii) the interests of consumers,\n(iii) the likelihood that, if the acquisition were put into effect,\nthe notification thresholds in section 51ABP(1) of the Act\nwould apply, and\n(iv) the likelihood that the acquisition, if put into effect, would\nin all the circumstances have the effect, or be likely to\nhave the effect, of substantially lessening competition in\nany market.\nBased on the information provided in the application, the ACCC\nconsiders that the Acquisition is unlikely to give rise to any material\nlessening of competition. In particular:\na. There is very limited horizontal overlap between WSP and\nTRC in the supply of goods or services in Australia. The\ninformation provided by WSP in its application indicates that\nTRC currently has no presence in Australia and generates\nnegligible revenue from offshore sales to customers in\nAustralia.\nb. The parties\u2019 combined market share in the broader supply of\nengineering consulting services in Australia is very low and\nany aggregation in more specialised service offerings would\nbe minimal.\nc. The parties are likely to continue to be constrained by\nalternative global or national suppliers of engineering\nconsulting services in Australia, including design and project\nmanagement services in the energy, environment, transport\nand infrastructure sectors.\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply.\nWhile the ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely\nto be met, given that material competition concerns are unlikely to\narise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required to\nbe notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition effects\nmore generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on notification\nwaivers and merger assessment guidelines."

    "commentary": "WSP's global acquisition of TRC Companies was the one of the first two acquisitions to be granted a notification waiver by the ACCC. Both parties supply engineering consulting services, including for energy, transport and infrastructure sectors. The ACCC determined the acquisition did not require notification because:\n\n- there is very limited horizontal overlap in Australia, as TRC has no Australian presence and generates negligible revenue from Australian customers;\n- the parties' combined market share in engineering consulting services in Australia is very low; and\n- alternative global and national suppliers remain.\n\nWhile notification thresholds were likely met, the ACCC waived the requirement given its view that there were minimal competition concerns.",
