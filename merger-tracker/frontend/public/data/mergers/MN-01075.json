CRG offers CRO services to\nhelp pharmaceutical and biotech customers (Sponsors) bring new\ntherapies and vaccines to market safely and efficiently.

In doing so, the ACCC must have\nregard to the object of the Act and all relevant matters, including the\ninterests of consumers.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotified acquisitions, see the ACCC\u2019s merger assessment guidelines\nand interim merger process guidelines.\nIn conducting its competition assessment, the ACCC has considered\nthe information and documents that were submitted with the\nnotification form and information from third partes.\nThe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition may be put into\neffect as it considers that the Acquisition is unlikely to have the\neffect of substantially lessening competition in any market. In\nreaching its decision, and based on the material before it, the ACCC\nmakes the following findings.\n\u2022 there is no horizontal overlap between the Parties\n\u2022 although the Parties both supply services to Sponsors, the\nAcquisition would be unlikely to give rise to conglomerate\ncompetition concerns. Having regard to the position of the\nParties in their respective markets, the presence of alternative\nsuppliers of both CRO services and digital endpoint collection\nservices, and customer behaviour, the merged entity would be\nunlikely to have the ability or incentive to foreclose other CRO\nproviders or other digital endpoint collection service providers,\nor engage in anti-competitive bundling/tying."
