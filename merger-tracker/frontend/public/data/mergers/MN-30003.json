It also offers longer-term keg leasing.\n\nKonvoy operates a keg services business in Australia and New Zealand. It offers short-term keg leasing (on a PPF basis), longer-term keg leasing, and keg maintenance and repair services.\n\n**Summary of horizontal and vertical overlaps**\n\nThe Parties are both suppliers of PPF services and, to a much lesser extent, longer term keg leasing to brewery customers in Australia.\n\nThere is no vertical overlap between the parties.",
