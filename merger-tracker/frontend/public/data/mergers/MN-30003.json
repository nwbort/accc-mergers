  "merger_description": "Acquisition\n\nThis notification concerns the proposed acquisition of certain Australian assets of Konvoy Holdings Pty Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) (**Konvoy**) by Kegstar Pty Limited (**Kegstar**), a wholly owned subsidiary of MicroStar Logistics, LLC (**Acquisition**).\n\nThe Australian assets which are proposed to be acquired pursuant to the Acquisition include:\n\n(a) kegs;\n\n(b) keg tracking technology hardware and software (known as 'Katch');\n\n(c) select employees; and\n\n(d) a keg repair and maintenance facility.\n\nThe Parties\n\nMicroStar Logistics, LLC, is a limited liability company incorporated in the United States and is indirectly wholly owned by MStar Holding Corporation. MicroStar entered the Australian market in 2021 via the acquisition of Kegstar from Brambles.\n\nIn Australia, Kegstar primarily offers a pay-per-fill keg management service (PPF). It also offers longer-term keg leasing.\n\nKonvoy operates a keg services business in Australia and New Zealand. It offers short-term keg leasing (on a PPF basis), longer-term keg leasing, and keg maintenance and repair services.\n\nSummary of horizontal and vertical overlaps\n\nThe Parties are both suppliers of PPF services and, to a much lesser extent, longer term keg leasing to brewery customers in Australia.\n\nThere is no vertical overlap between the parties.",
