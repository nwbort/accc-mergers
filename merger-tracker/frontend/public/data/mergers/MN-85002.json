          "item": "Reasons for determination",
          "details": "When making a determination in Phase 1, the Australian Competition\nand Consumer Commission (ACCC) undertakes a competition\nassessment and considers whether it is appropriate for an\nacquisition to be approved or subject to further assessment in\nPhase 2 in accordance with section 51ABZJ of the Competition and\nConsumer Act 2010 (Cth) (the Act). In doing so, the ACCC must have\nregard to the object of the Act and all relevant matters, including the\ninterests of consumers.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotified acquisitions, see the ACCC\u2019s merger assessment guidelines\nand interim merger process guidelines.\nIn conducting its competition assessment, the ACCC has considered\nthe information and documents that were submitted with the\nnotification form as well as further information provided by\nServiceNow following pre-notification engagement with the ACCC.\nThe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition may be put into\neffect as it considers that the Acquisition is unlikely to have the\neffect of substantially lessening competition in any market in\nAustralia. In reaching its decision, and based on the material before\nit, the ACCC makes the following findings:\n\u2022 Veza has a very limited presence in Australia.\n\u2022 There are no horizontal overlaps or vertical relationships\nbetween ServiceNow and Veza in Australia.\n\u2022 The merged entity is unlikely to have the ability or incentive to\nforeclose Veza\u2019s competitors in IAM (including IGA) by\npreventing their integration with ServiceNow, or to take other\nactions that would lead to conglomerate competition concerns\nin Australia. Also, ServiceNow\u2019s offering relies on permitting\nintegrations with a wide range of different platforms, tools and\nsoftware in order to perform its functions and remain attractive\nto customers.\n\u2022 ServiceNow\u2019s primary focus is the supply of integrated IT\nworkflow management software to enterprise customers. It\nfaces competition from alternative providers of such software,\nincluding Microsoft, Broadcom, Oracle and Atlassian."
