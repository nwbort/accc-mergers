In doing so, the ACCC must have\nregard to the object of the Act and all relevant matters, including the\ninterests of consumers.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotified acquisitions, see the ACCC\u2019s merger assessment guidelines\nand interim merger process guidelines.\nIn conducting its competition assessment, the ACCC has considered\nthe information and documents that were submitted with the\nnotification form and information from third parties.\nThe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition may be put into\neffect as it considers the Acquisition is unlikely to have the effect of\nsubstantially lessening competition in any market. In reaching its\ndecision, and based on the material before it, the ACCC makes the\nfollowing findings:\n\u2022 there is no horizontal competitive overlap\n\u2022 there are sufficient suitable alternative sites available for\nKDau\u2019s competitors\n\u2022 the Acquisition does not otherwise limit or prevent\ncompetition from rivals."
