In particular:\na. There is no horizontal overlap between the KKR led\nconsortium\u2019s portfolio companies\u2019 and Saviynt in the supply\nof identify focussed cybersecurity software.\nb. Whilst there is a potential vertical and/or conglomerate\nrelationship between cybersecurity products supplied by the\nKKR led consortium and Saviynt, the parties are likely to\ncontinue to be competitively constrained by a wide range of\nalternative suppliers of cybersecurity and identity focussed\ncybersecurity software in Australia and globally.\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply.\nWhile the ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely\nto be met, given that material competition concerns are unlikely to\narise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required\nto be notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
