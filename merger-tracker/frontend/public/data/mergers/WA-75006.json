          "item": "Explanation for\ndetermination",
          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided with the notification waiver application and\ncertain publicly available information, and had regard to the factors\nin section 51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010\n(Cth) (Act).\nBased on the information currently before it, the ACCC considers that\nthe Acquisition is unlikely to give rise to any material lessening of\ncompetition. In particular:\na. there is no horizontal overlap between Playlist\u2019s and EGYM\u2019s\noffering in Australia\nb. there appears to be a low risk of foreclosure or other\nconcerning vertical or conglomerate effects resulting from\nexclusionary conduct, bundling or tying of products post-\nAcquisition\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply.\nWhile the ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely\nto be met, given that material competition concerns are unlikely to\narise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required\nto be notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
