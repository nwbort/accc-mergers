In\nparticular:\na. There is no horizontal competitive overlap.\nb. There appear to be alternative sites available for H-E\nMining\u2019s and H-E Cooling\u2019s competitors.\nc. The Acquisition does not appear likely to otherwise limit or\nprevent competition from rivals.\nIn these circumstances, the ACCC does not consider it necessary to\nreach a concluded view on the likelihood of the notification\nthresholds being met.\nGiven that material competition concerns are unlikely to arise, the\nACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required to be\nnotified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
