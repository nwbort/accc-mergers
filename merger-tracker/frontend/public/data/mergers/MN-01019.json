  "merger_description": "Pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase Agreement, the retail sites operated by EG Australia will become Ampol owned and operated retail sites, subject to proposed divestitures.\n\nAmpol Retail Holding Pty Ltd is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ampol Limited (Ampol), which is listed on the ASX (ASX: ALD). Ampol is a transport energy provider which purchases, refines, imports and distributes petroleum products in Australia and is rolling out electric vehicle (EV) public charging networks. Ampol also has operations and interests across Singapore, New Zealand, Philippines and the US. In Australia, Ampol also has a network of fuel and retail convenience sites.\n\nEG Australia is a convenience retailer of fuel, food to go and convenience products which commenced operations in Australia in April 2019 when it acquired the Woolworths retail fuel and convenience sites. Globally, the EG Group operates fuel, convenience and food-to-go retail offers in Europe and the US.\n\nAmpol and EG Australia overlap in the supply of fuel and convenience products in all Australian states and territories at a retail level:\n\n* Ampol owns and operates\u00a0584 retail fuel sites under the \u201cAmpol\u201d brand and 39 unstaffed sites under the \u201cU-GO\u201d brand. U-GO sites sell fuel only with no convenience offering.\u00a0Ampol sets the retail fuel prices for these sites.\n* EG Australia owns and operates approximately 512 \u201cEG\u201d branded sites.\n\nAmpol supplies fuel to EG Australia under a wholesale fuel supply agreement, meaning EG Australia\u2019s sites supply \u201cAmpol\u201d fuel.\n\nRemedy offer:\n\nAmpol has made a remedy offer to divest 19 retail fuel and convenience sites in areas across Australia in the form of an undertaking pursuant to s87B of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth). Ampol has provided a draft undertaking and a summary of its proposal, which are included below.\u00a0These contain more details on the remedy offer.",
