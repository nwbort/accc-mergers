In doing so, the ACCC must have\nregard to the object of the Act and all relevant matters, including the\ninterests of consumers.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotified acquisitions, see the ACCC\u2019s merger assessment guidelines\nand interim merger process guidelines.\nIn conducting its competition assessment, the ACCC has considered\nthe information and documents that were submitted with the\nnotification form and publicly available information.\nThe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition may be put into\neffect as it considers that the Acquisition is unlikely to have the\neffect of substantially lessening competition in any market. In\nreaching its decision, and based on the material before it, the ACCC\nmakes the following findings.\n\u2022 There is no horizontal overlap between the activities of Danone\nand DSDA.\n\u2022 By increasing Danone\u2019s interest in DSDA from 50% to 51%, the\nproposed Acquisition will increase the degree of control held by\nDanone, and Danone and DSDA will be related bodies corporate\nfor the purposes of the Act. However, given the particular\ngovernance rights already in place between Danone and Saputo\nunder this joint venture arrangement (and the degree of control\nand influence already afforded to Danone), and the fact that\nDanone and DSDA are not competitors in Australia, the ACCC\nconsiders that the proposed Acquisition is unlikely to\nsignificantly alter the nature of the existing relationship between\nDanone and DSDA or have a significant effect on competitive\ndynamics.\n\u2022 The Acquisition does not impact the level of competition that\nDSDA would face in the manufacture and wholesale supply of\nfresh dairy products in Australia."
