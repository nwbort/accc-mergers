They are often\nmanufactured overseas and imported into Australia, either on their\nown or as a component as part of a finished product. Neither of the\nParties manufacture connectors in Australia.\nThere is no single connector that is ideal for every application, and\nas a result there are several types of connectors to meet the specific\nneeds of customers."

In doing so, the ACCC must have\nregard to the object of the Act and all relevant matters, including the\ninterests of consumers.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotified acquisitions, see the ACCC\u2019s merger assessment guidelines\nand interim merger process guidelines.\nIn conducting its competition assessment, the ACCC has considered\nthe information and documents that were submitted with the\nnotification form as well as further information provided by Molex in\nresponse to a request for information.\nThe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition may be put into\neffect as it considers that the Acquisition is unlikely to have the\neffect of substantially lessening competition in any market in\nAustralia. In reaching its decision, and based on the material before\nit, the ACCC makes the following findings:\n\u2022 Molex and Smiths Interconnect do not appear to compete\nclosely in the supply of connectors in Australia, with the\nproducts supplied by the Parties in Australia used for different\nend-use applications.\n\u2022 the Parties\u2019 market share aggregation in the area of overlap in\nAustralia as a result of the Acquisition is estimated to be very\nlow, and\n\u2022 other companies would continue to supply connectors in\nAustralia, including TE Connectivity, Amphenol and Foxconn."
