          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided with the notification waiver application and had\nregard to the factors in section 51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition and\nConsumer Act 2010 (Cth) (Act).\nBased on the information provided by the applicant, the ACCC\nconsiders that the Acquisition is unlikely to give rise to any material\nlessening of competition. In particular:\na. The size of the interest in Baseten being acquired by\nBlackbird Ventures is small.\nb. Baseten has a single customer in Australia.\nc. There does not appear to be horizontal overlap between\nBlackbird Ventures\u2019 portfolio companies and Baseten in the\nsupply of AI inference products in Australia.\nd. There appears to be a low risk of foreclosure or other\nconcerning vertical or conglomerate effects resulting from\nexclusionary conduct, bundling or tying of products post-\nacquisition.\nGiven the above considerations that material competition concerns\nare unlikely to arise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is\nnot required to be notified.\nIn these circumstances, the ACCC does not consider it necessary to\nreach a concluded view on the likelihood of the notification\nthresholds being met.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
