          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided with the notification waiver application and had\nregard to the factors in section 51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition and\nConsumer Act 2010 (Cth) (Act).\nBased on the information provided in the application, the ACCC\nconsiders that the Acquisition is unlikely to give rise to any material\nlessening of competition. In particular:\na. There is no horizontal overlap between Alpine Investors\u2019\nportfolio companies and PlayHQ in the supply of sports\nmanagement software in Australia.\nb. There are a number of alternative suppliers of sports\nmanagement software in Australia.\nc. While there is a potential conglomerate relationship between\nAlpine Investors\u2019 or ASG\u2019s portfolio companies and GameOn,\nthe risk of the merged entity foreclosing rival suppliers of\nsports management software or other software in Australia\nappears to be low, given the availability of other suppliers.\nGiven the above considerations that material competition concerns\nare unlikely to arise, the ACCC does not consider it necessary to\nreach a concluded view on the likelihood of the notification\nthresholds being met.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
