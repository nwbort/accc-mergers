    "commentary": "Caterpillar's acquisition of mining software provider RPMGlobal was cleared after assessment of vertical integration concerns and was the first acquisition for which the ACCC included a substantive statement of reasons. The ACCC examined whether Caterpillar could access competitively significant information about rivals through RPM's software. The ACCC concluded that:\n\n- Caterpillar is unlikely to foreclose rival mining equipment manufacturers by denying access to RPM's asset management and simulation software;\n- alternative software suppliers exist (including SAP, Oracle, Hexagon, Deswik, and others);\n- physical and contractual limitations prevent Caterpillar from accessing competitively significant information about rivals, as RPM's software is typically hosted on customer premises; and\n- customers would have incentives to accommodate rival OEMs using alternative software if RPM's ongoing use led to lessening of competition.",
