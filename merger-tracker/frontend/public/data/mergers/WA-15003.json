          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided with the notification waiver application and had\nregard to the factors in section 51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition and\nConsumer Act 2010 (Cth) (Act).\nBased on the information provided in the application, the ACCC\nconsiders that the Acquisition is unlikely to give rise to any material\nlessening of competition. In particular:\na. While there is horizontal overlap between Coforge and\nEncora in the supply of digital engineering services in\nAustralia, the merger parties\u2019 combined share is low.\nb. There are alternative suppliers of digital engineering services\nin Australia.\nIn these circumstances, the ACCC does not consider it necessary to\nreach a concluded view on the likelihood of the notification\nthresholds being met.\nGiven that material competition concerns are unlikely to arise, the\nACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required to be\nnotified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
