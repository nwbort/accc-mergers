It considers that the Acquisition warrants\nconsideration through the notification process, including via further\ninformation gathering and consultation with third parties. This may\ninclude a focus on:\na. The extent of any horizontal overlap between Intrepid\nTravel and Wild Bush Luxury in the supply of tourism\nservices in Australia, and particularly in Maria Island, the\nTop End and Flinders Ranges,\nb. The extent to which the parties are likely to face\ncompetition from alternative suppliers at these\nlocations, particularly in relation to Maria Island where\nalternatives appear limited.\nGiven the above, the ACCC has determined not to make the\nnotification waiver determination applied for.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
