Salesforce is a publicly listed\ncompany on the New York Stock Exchange and is headquartered in\nSan Francisco, California. Salesforce offers a suite of artificial\nintelligence (AI) agents, which are integrated with its core CRM\nofferings and automate tasks related to sales, service, marketing\nand commerce, such as personalised engagement with potential and\nexisting customers and scheduling meetings.\nThe target, Qualified, is a supplier of an AI-based sales development\nrepresentative (SDR) agent, known as Piper, which integrates with\nSalesforce\u2019s CRM platform. Piper is an agentic marketing product\nthat is focused on engaging customers through a company\u2019s website\nand converting them into buyers.

          "item": "Explanation for\ndetermination",
          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided with the notification waiver application, public\ninformation and other industry information in the possession of the\nACCC from its consideration of prior matters, and had regard to the\nfactors in section 51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition and Consumer Act\n2010 (Cth) (Act), being:\n(i) the object of the Act,\n(ii) the interests of consumers,\n(iii) the likelihood that, if the acquisition were put into effect, the\nnotification thresholds in section 51ABP(1) of the Act would\napply, and\n(iv) the likelihood that the acquisition, if put into effect, would in\nall the circumstances have the effect, or be likely to have the\neffect, of substantially lessening competition in any market.\nBased on the information provided in the application, including\nSalesforce\u2019s revenue in Australia and the transaction value, the\nACCC considers that, if the Acquisition were put into effect, the\nnotification thresholds would be met.\nThe ACCC also considers that the Acquisition may raise competition\nissues. In particular:\na. Salesforce is the leading provider of CRM software to\nbusinesses in Australia and is significantly larger than the\nnext largest supplier.\nb. The parties operate in complex and dynamic markets,\nincluding the provision of agentic AI.\nc. There is a vertical relationship between the products\nsupplied by Salesforce and Qualified. The extent of the\nparties\u2019 ability and/or incentive to foreclose rivals to\nQualified or Salesforce warrants further consideration to be\nable to form a conclusive view on the competition impacts\nof the Acquisition, despite the relatively small presence of\nQualified in Australia at present.\nThe ACCC considers that these potential competition issues warrant\nconsideration through the notification process, including via\nconsultation with third parties.\nGiven the above, the ACCC has determined not to make the\nnotification waiver determination applied for.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
