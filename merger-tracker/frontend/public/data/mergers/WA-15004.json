In particular:\na. the Acquisition gives rise to a limited horizontal overlap in\nthe supply of out-of-home advertising, gift cards, and other\nancillary or incidental services provided at shopping centres\nb. any increment to ART\u2019s share of revenue in the above\nservices arising from the Acquisition is low\nc. the presence of alternative suppliers of advertising\nopportunities, gift cards, and shopping centre ancillary\nservices.\nIn these circumstances, the ACCC does not consider it necessary to\nreach a concluded view on the likelihood of the notification\nthresholds being met.\nGiven that material competition concerns are unlikely to arise, the\nACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required to be\nnotified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
