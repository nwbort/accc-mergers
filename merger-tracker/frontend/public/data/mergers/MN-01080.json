          "details": "When making a determination in Phase 1, the Australian Competition\nand Consumer Commission (ACCC) undertakes a competition\nassessment and considers whether it is appropriate for an\nacquisition to be approved or subject to further assessment in\nPhase 2 in accordance with section 51ABZJ of the Competition and\nConsumer Act 2010 (Cth) (the Act). In doing so, the ACCC must have\nregard to the object of the Act and all relevant matters, including the\ninterests of consumers.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotified acquisitions, see the ACCC\u2019s merger assessment guidelines\nand interim merger process guidelines.\nIn conducting its competition assessment, the ACCC has considered\nthe information and documents that were submitted with the\nnotification form and information provided by third parties.\nThe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition may be put into\neffect as it considers that the Acquisition is unlikely to have the\neffect of substantially lessening competition in any market. In\nreaching its decision, and based on the material before it, the ACCC\nmakes the following findings.\n\u25aa The increase in L'Or\u00e9al\u2019s market share of the wholesale supply\nof fragrances in Australia as a result of the Acquisition is\nestimated to be low, including in the wholesale supply of\npremium fragrances.\n\u25aa The Parties would likely continue face competition from\nalternative wholesale suppliers of fragrances in Australia\nincluding Puig, Coty, InterParfums, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Revlon,\nShiseido, Chanel, LVMH, Richemont and Herm\u00e8s International.\n\u25aa The increase in L\u2019Oreal\u2019s market shares in the wholesale supply\nof each of the ancillary products including scented candles,\nskincare and bath and shower products as a result of the\nAcquisition is very low. To the extent that the parties overlap in\nthe supply of the ancillary products, L\u2019Oreal will also continue to\nface competition from alternative suppliers."
