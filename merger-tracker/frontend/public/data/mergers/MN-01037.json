  "merger_description": "Anglo American plc (Anglo American) proposes to acquire, through its affiliates and subsidiaries, the entire issued share capital of Teck Resources Limited (Teck Resources) by way of statutory plan of arrangement (similar to an Australian Scheme of Arrangement) to effect a merger between the parties.\n\nAnglo American is a global mining company focused on the production of copper and iron ore. It also produces steelmaking coal, nickel, diamonds, and molybdenum and holds a joint venture interest in Samancor Manganese. Anglo American is a publicly traded company listed on the London Stock Exchange, with secondary listings on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, SIX Swiss Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange and the Namibia Securities Exchange.\n\nAnglo American\u2019s business in Australia is primarily focused on the production and sale of steelmaking (or metallurgical) coal for export to Asia, Europe and South America, although it has taken steps to sell this business. Anglo American also has some exploration activities in Australia.\n\nTeck Resources is a Canadian mining company with operations in multiple countries, including Canada, the United States, Chile and Peru.

In addition, Teck Resources produces lead, silver, gold, molybdenum, and various other specialty and other metals, chemicals and fertilizer products. Teck\u2019s shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.\n\nTeck Resources\u2019 business in Australia primarily involves the supply of zinc concentrate to Australian customers. Teck Resources does not supply copper to any Australian customers and has no copper or zinc mining or production operations in Australia. Its local presence is limited to exploration and closure activities.\n\nAnglo American and Teck Resources' primary overlap globally is in the supply of copper products (mainly copper concentrate and secondary copper products), along with minor global overlaps in certain by-products of copper and other mining and processing activities, being molybdenum and sulphuric acid. \u00a0There are no horizontal overlaps in respect of the supply of goods or services in Australia; neither Anglo American nor Teck Resources have copper mining or production activities in Australia, or supply copper, molybdenum or sulphuric acid to Australian customers.\u00a0The parties have not identified any non-horizontal relationships as being relevant to Australia.",

In doing so, the ACCC must have\nregard to the object of the Act and all relevant matters, including the\ninterests of consumers.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotified acquisitions, see the ACCC\u2019s merger assessment guidelines\nand interim merger process guidelines.\nIn conducting its competition assessment, the ACCC has considered\nthe information and documents that were submitted with the\nnotification form as well as further information provided by Anglo\nAmerican in response to a request for information.\nThe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition may be put into\neffect as it considers that the Acquisition is unlikely to have the\neffect of substantially lessening competition in any market in\nAustralia. In reaching its decision, and based on the material before\nit, the ACCC makes the following findings:\n\u2022 there are no horizontal overlaps or vertical relationships between\nthe Parties in respect of the supply of goods or services in\nAustralia\n\u2022 the merged entity\u2019s share of each market where there is an\noverlap globally would be small to modest, and multiple\nalternative suppliers of copper concentrate, molybdenum and\nsulphuric acid globally will remain."
