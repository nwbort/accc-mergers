(**Carlyle**) is a global investment firm headquartered in Washington DC, USA, with assets under management across three business segments: (i) Global Private Equity (including corporate private equity and real estate funds); (ii) Global Credit (including liquid credit, illiquid credit and real assets credit); and (iii) Carlyle AlpInvest (including primary, secondary, and co-investments, commingled funds, and separately managed accounts).\n\nPeloton Computer Enterprises Ltd. (**Peloton**) is a global supplier of software predominantly used by exploration and production (**E&P**) operators in the upstream oil and gas industry. E&P is an early phase in the oil and gas industry concerned with locating and extracting raw materials.\n\nCarlyle, via its controlled investment vehicle (CG Panther Parentco, L.P., **Panther**), proposes to acquire non-voting and non-convertible preferred equity in Peloton, as well as warrants that (if exercised) would provide Carlyle with up to c. 14% of the fully-diluted equity in Peloton (pro forma for the transaction). Carlyle will ultimately (via Panther) hold only (i) preferred equity and (ii) warrants amounting up to c. 14% holding of common equity interests in Peloton on a lookthrough basis.",

          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided by the applicant, including in the notification\nwaiver application, and had regard to the factors in section\n51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (Act).\nBased on the information provided by the applicant, the ACCC\nconsiders that the Acquisition is unlikely to give rise to any material\nlessening of competition. In particular:\na. The Acquisition does not appear likely to result in any\nhorizontal overlaps between Carlyle (including its connected\nentities) and Peloton in Australia.\nb. There appears to be a low risk of foreclosure or other\nconcerning vertical or conglomerate effects resulting from\nexclusionary conduct, bundling or tying of products post-\nacquisition.\nc. Peloton appears to have a relatively small presence in\nAustralia.\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply.\nWhile the ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely\nto be met, given that material competition concerns are unlikely to\narise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required\nto be notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
