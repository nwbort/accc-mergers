          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided by the applicant, including in the notification\nwaiver application, and had regard to the factors in section\n51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (Act).\nBased on the information provided by the applicant and publicly\navailable information, the ACCC considers that the Acquisition is\nunlikely to give rise to any material lessening of competition. In\nparticular:\na. While there is horizontal overlap between the services\nsupplied by Treysta, its connected entities and\nLocumsgroup, the parties\u2019 combined market shares in the\nsupply of financial planning, tax and accounting services in\nSydney and nationally are low and the Acquisition will result\nin a small increment to Treysta and its connected entities\u2019\nmarket shares in the supply of those services.\nb. The market concentration in the supply of financial planning\nand tax and accounting services is low and there are several\nthousand competing suppliers of such services nationally,\nincluding many competing suppliers in Sydney, that are\nexpected to continue to constrain the parties.\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply.\nWhile the ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely\nto be met, given the above consideration that material competition\nconcerns are unlikely to arise, the ACCC considers that the\nAcquisition is not required to be notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
