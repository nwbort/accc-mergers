In\ndoing so, the ACCC must have regard to the object of the Act and all\nrelevant matters, including the interests of consumers.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering notified\nacquisitions, see the ACCC\u2019s merger assessment guidelines and interim\nmerger process guidelines.\nIn conducting its competition assessment, the ACCC has considered the\ninformation and documents that were submitted with the notification\nform.\nThe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition may be put into effect as it\nconsiders that the Acquisition is unlikely to have the effect of\nsubstantially lessening competition in any market. In reaching its\ndecision, and based on the material before it, the ACCC makes the\nfollowing findings:\n\u2022 there is no horizontal competitive overlap\n\u2022 there are sufficient suitable alternative sites available for Asahi\u2019s\ncompetitors\n\u2022 the acquisition does not otherwise limit or prevent competition\nfrom rivals."
