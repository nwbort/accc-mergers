In particular:\n\u2022 While there is horizontal overlap between Quay and\nAustralian Venue Co, the combined share of the parties in\nthe supply of retail hospitality restaurants in the Circular\nQuay area of Sydney is low.\n\u2022 The presence of alternative suppliers of retail hospitality\nrestaurants in proximity to the Circular Quay area of Sydney.\nIn these circumstances, the ACCC does not consider it necessary to\nreach a concluded view on the likelihood of the notification\nthresholds being met. Given that material competition concerns are\nunlikely to arise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not\nrequired to be notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
