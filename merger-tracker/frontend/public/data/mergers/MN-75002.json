In doing so, the ACCC must have\nregard to the object of the Act and all relevant matters, including the\ninterests of consumers.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotified acquisitions, see the ACCC\u2019s merger assessment guidelines\nand interim merger process guidelines.\nIn conducting its competition assessment, the ACCC has considered\nthe information and documents that were submitted with the\nnotification form and publicly available information.\nThe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition may be put into\neffect as it considers that the Acquisition is unlikely to have the\neffect of substantially lessening competition in any market. In\nreaching its decision, and based on the material before it, the ACCC\nmakes the following findings.\n\u2022 The aggregation arising from the Acquisition is estimated to be\nlow at a local and regional level (as well as at the national level)\ngiven the number of beds at Sunnymeade Park and the total\nnumber of beds available in the relevant areas.\n\u2022 Opal Healthcare would likely continue to face competition from\nalternative suppliers of residential aged care facilities including\nfrom large national providers such as Bolton Clarke and Regis\nwhich have facilities in the local area."
