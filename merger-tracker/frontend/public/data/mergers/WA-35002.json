Softeon\nis headquartered in Reston, Virginia, USA and has a very limited\npresence in Australia.\nBoth parties supply enterprise application software, however IFS\u2019s\nAustralian business mainly supplies enterprise resource planning\nservices, whereas Softeon specialises in warehouse management\nand supply chain management solutions.

          "item": "Explanation for\ndetermination",
          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided with the notification waiver application and had\nregard to the factors in section 51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition and\nConsumer Act 2010 (Cth) (Act).\nBased on the information provided in the application, the ACCC\nconsiders that the Acquisition is unlikely to give rise to any material\nlessening of competition. In particular:\na. Softeon currently has a very small presence in Australia.\nb. There is a small horizontal overlap between IFS and Softeon\nin the supply of enterprise application software in Australia,\nand no overlap in the supply of enterprise resource planning\nand supply chain management services.\nc. The parties\u2019 combined shares in the supply of enterprise\napplication software in Australia are small, and they are likely\nto continue to be constrained by several competitors.\nd. There is a low risk of concerning conglomerate effects\nresulting from bundling or tying of products post-merger.\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply.\nWhile the ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely\nto be met, given that material competition concerns are unlikely to\narise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required to\nbe notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition effects\nmore generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on notification\nwaivers and merger assessment guidelines."
