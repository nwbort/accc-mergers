          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided with the notification waiver application and had\nregard to the factors in section 51ABV(2)(b) of the Act.\nBased on the information provided in the application, including the\nrevenue of the parties in Australia and the transaction value, the\nACCC considers that, if the Acquisition were put into effect, the\nnotification thresholds would be met.\nThe ACCC is unable to reach a view that the Acquisition would not be\nlikely to raise competition issues in any market based on the\ninformation provided. It considers that the Acquisition warrants\nconsideration through the notification process, including via further\ninformation gathering and consultation with third parties. This may\ninclude a focus on:\na. The extent of any horizontal overlap between Henkel and\nATP in the supply of PSA tapes in Australia.\nb. The vertical relationship between the products supplied by\nHenkel and ATP and the likely impact of the Acquisition on\nthe parties\u2019 ability and/or incentive to foreclose rivals.\nGiven the above, the ACCC has determined not to make the\nnotification waiver determination applied for.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
