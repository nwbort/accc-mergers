In particular:\na. while there is horizontal overlap between Star Hotels and the\nYandina Hotel, concentration and the combined share of the\nparties in the supply of accommodation, dining, functions,\ngaming and liquor services in the broader Sunshine Coast\narea is low\nb. the presence of alternative suppliers of accommodation,\ndining, functions, gaming and liquor in the broader Sunshine\nCoast and Noosa area.\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply.\nWhile the ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely\nto be met, given that material competition concerns are unlikely to\narise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required\nto be notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
