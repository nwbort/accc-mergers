          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided with the notification waiver application and had\nregard to the factors in section 51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition and\nConsumer Act 2010 (Cth) (Act)\nBased on the information provided in the application, the ACCC\nconsiders that the Acquisition is unlikely to give rise to any material\nlessening of competition. In particular:\na. whilst there is horizontal overlap between the CRS services\nsupplied by Re.Group and the Scout Recycling Centre in\nSlacks Creek, there are alternative suppliers of CRS services\nand the incremental share resulting from the proposed\nAcquisition is low.\nb. the parties are expected to be constrained by alternative\nsuppliers of CRS services in Queensland as a whole, and in\nthe Greater Brisbane and Gold Coast region. There are\nseveral other suppliers that operate CRS refund/collection\npoints in that region, and in the area surrounding the Scout\nRecycling Centre in Slacks Creek.\nc. the organisation appointed by the Queensland Government\nto run the CRS, Container Exchange (Qld) Limited (COEX)\ndetermines the prices, number, location, and operators of\nCRS collection points.\nOn the information provided to the ACCC in the application, it is not\nclear whether or not the monetary thresholds are met. However,\ngiven that the ACCC considers that material competition concerns\nare unlikely to arise, it is not necessary to reach a concluded view on\nthe likelihood of the notification thresholds being met.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
