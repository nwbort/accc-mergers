In doing so, the ACCC must have\nregard to the object of the Act and all relevant matters, including the\ninterests of consumers.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotified acquisitions, see the ACCC\u2019s merger assessment guidelines\nand interim merger process guidelines.\nIn conducting its competition assessment, the ACCC has considered\nthe information and documents that were submitted with the\nnotification form.\nThe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition may be put into\neffect as it considers that the Acquisition is unlikely to have the\neffect of substantially lessening competition in any market. In\nreaching its decision, and based on the material before it, the ACCC\nmakes the following findings:\n\u2022 there is no horizontal competitive overlap\n\u2022 there are suitable alternative sites available for Asahi\u2019s\ncompetitors"
