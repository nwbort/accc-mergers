Ramsay does not currently have any facilities in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) or its surrounding regions. The closest Ramsay operated private hospitals to NCPH are Southern Highlands Private Hospital in Bowral, New South Wales (NSW) and Nowra Private Hospital in Nowra, NSW.\n\nNCPH is a private hospital in Garran, ACT which is currently operated by Healthscope, a private hospital operator with 36 hospitals Australia-wide. In May 2025, Healthscope\u2019s parent entities went into voluntary administration and receivers and administrators were appointed by its lenders and the Healthscope Board, respectively, to conduct an orderly sale of the hospitals in its network.\n\nPrivate hospitals supply services to patients, private health funds in respect of their members and to government for Medicare patients. Private hospital operators also supply facilities to medical and allied health professionals providing services within the hospitals that they operate.",

          "details": "When making a determination in Phase 1, the Australian Competition\nand Consumer Commission (ACCC) undertakes a competition\nassessment and considers whether it is appropriate for an\nacquisition to be approved or subject to further assessment in\nPhase 2 in accordance with section 51ABZJ of the Competition and\nConsumer Act 2010 (Cth) (the Act). In doing so, the ACCC must have\nregard to the object of the Act and all relevant matters, including the\ninterests of consumers.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotified acquisitions, see the ACCC\u2019s merger assessment guidelines\nand interim merger process guidelines.\nIn conducting its competition assessment, the ACCC has considered\nthe information and documents that were submitted with the\nnotification form and information from third parties.\nThe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition may be put into\neffect as it considers that the Acquisition is unlikely to have the\neffect of substantially lessening competition in any market. In\nreaching its decision, and based on the material before it, the ACCC\nmakes the following findings:\n\u2022 there is limited horizontal overlap between National Capital and\nRamsay-operated private hospitals, as these hospitals have\nlargely different geographical catchment zones for patients, and\nlimited overlap of Visiting Medical Officers (VMOs). Accordingly,\nthe Acquisition is not likely to enable Ramsay to profitably\nworsen either non-price terms to patients, or price or non-price\nterms to VMOs serving the Canberra region; and\n\u2022 the Acquisition is not likely to substantially alter the competitive\ndynamics between Ramsay and private health insurers, such\nthat there would be a substantial lessening of competition in the\nsupply of Hospital Purchaser Provider Agreements (HPPAs) to\nprivate health insurers, enabling Ramsay to profitably increase\nthe prices or worsen the non-price terms of its HPPAs with\nprivate health insurers, either in relation to Ramsay\u2019s existing\nhospitals or National Capital itself."
