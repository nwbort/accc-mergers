          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (the ACCC) has considered\nthe information provided with the notification waiver application and\nhad regard to the factors in section 51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition\nand Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (the Act).\nBased on the information provided in the application, the ACCC\nconsiders that the Acquisition is unlikely to give rise to any material\nlessening of competition. In particular:\na. There is no horizontal overlap between Apollo\u2019s portfolio of\ncontrolled companies and Lecta in the supply of paper\nproducts in Australia.\nb. There is no vertical relationship in Australia between Apollo\u2019s\nportfolio of controlled companies and Lecta.\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply.\nWhile the ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely\nto be met, given that material competition concerns are unlikely to\narise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required\nto be notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
