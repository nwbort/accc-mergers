In particular:\na. The Acquisition involves the transfer of assets between\nStockland-controlled entities.\nb. There is no horizontal consolidation or removal of a\ncompetitor as a result of the Acquisition.\nGiven the above considerations that material competition concerns\nare unlikely to arise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is\nnot required to be notified.\nIn these circumstances, the ACCC does not consider it necessary to\nreach a concluded view on the likelihood of the notification\nthresholds being met.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nThe ACCC notes that it also considered the potential application of\nsection 51ABD (internal restructures and reorganisations) of the Act.\nThe application states that, on the facts of this matter, including the\nparticular entities and structures involved, it was not clear that the\nAcquisition fell within that provision. Given this uncertainty, the\nACCC considered it appropriate to assess the notification waiver\napplication on the basis that the acquisition provisions in the Act\napplied to the Acquisition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
