          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (the ACCC) has considered\nthe information provided with the notification waiver application and\nhad regard to the factors in section 51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition\nand Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (the Act).\nBased on the information provided in the application, the ACCC\nconsiders that the Acquisition is unlikely to give rise to any material\nlessening of competition. In particular:\na. There is a small horizontal overlap between Sony and\nPeanuts Worldwide in the supply of character, film and TV\nlicensing in Australia.\nb. There are alternative suppliers of character, film and TV\nlicensing in Australia.\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply. While\nthe ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely to be\nmet, given that material competition concerns are unlikely to arise,\nthe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required to be\nnotified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
