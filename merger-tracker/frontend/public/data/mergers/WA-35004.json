In particular:\na. Ex Nihilo has a small presence in Australia.\nb. The horizontal overlap between entities controlled by LCAT\nand Ex Nihilo in the wholesale and retail supply of perfumes\nin Australia appears to be small.\nc. The parties\u2019 combined share of supply in the wholesale and\nretail supply of perfumes is low.\nd. There are numerous alternative wholesale and retail\nsuppliers of perfumes in Australia.\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply.\nWhile the ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely\nto be met, given that material competition concerns are unlikely to\narise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required\nto be notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
