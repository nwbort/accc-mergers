  "merger_description": "CVS Vets (Australia) Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of CVS (Australia) Holdings Pty Ltd which is part of CVS Group Plc (together, CVS Group) proposes to acquire 100% of the shares of Pittwater Animal Hospital, a small animal veterinary practice in Warriewood in Sydney's Northern Beaches region (the Acquisition).\n\nCVS Group is an integrated veterinary services provider based in the United Kingdom, and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
