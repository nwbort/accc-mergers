          "details": "In making this notification waiver determination, the Australian\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has considered the\ninformation provided with the notification waiver application and had\nregard to the factors in section 51ABV(2)(b) of the Competition and\nConsumer Act 2010 (Cth) (the Act), being:\n(i) the object of the Act,\n(ii) the interests of consumers,\n(iii) the likelihood that, if the acquisition were put into effect,\nthe notification thresholds in section 51ABP(1) of the\nAct would apply, and\n(iv) the likelihood that the acquisition, if put into effect,\nwould in all the circumstances have the effect, or be\nlikely to have the effect, of substantially lessening\ncompetition in any market.\nBased on the information provided in the application, the ACCC\nconsiders that the Acquisition is unlikely to give rise to any material\nlessening of competition. In particular:\na. There is very limited horizontal overlap between entities\nassociated with Ethos (i.e. TPG or TPG\u2019s portfolio\ncompanies) and EMIS in the supply of healthcare software in\nAustralia.\ni. Nextech supplies speciality-specific electronic\nmedical record and practice management software,\nto customers such as dermatology and plastic\nsurgery clinics in Australia. Covetrus supplies\nelectronic medical record and practice management\nsoftware to veterinary practices.\nii. In Australia, EMIS\u2019 activities are limited and currently\nonly involve the supply of certain maintenance\nservices to a single customer in connection with a\nlegacy EPR system.\nb. The parties are likely to continue to be constrained by\nalternative suppliers of EPR systems and other healthcare\nsoftware in Australia.\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply.\nWhile the ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely\nto be met, given that material competition concerns are unlikely to\narise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required\nto be notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."

EMIS's core product is a primary care electronic patient record (EPR) system. The ACCC determined the acquisition did not require notification because:\n\n- there is very limited horizontal overlap in Australia between TPG's portfolio companies (Nextech supplies specialty-specific software to dermatology/plastic surgery clinics, while Covetrus supplies software to veterinary practices) and EMIS;\n- EMIS' Australian activities are limited to maintenance services for a single customer with a legacy EPR system; and\n- alternative suppliers of EPR systems and healthcare software remain in Australia.\n\nWhile notification thresholds were likely met, the ACCC waived the requirement given its view that there were minimal competition concerns.",
