    "commentary": "Carlyle's acquisition of BASF's Coatings division was cleared by the ACCC. The transaction involves Carlyle acquiring sole control of BASF Coatings, with BASF retaining a 40% non-controlling stake. BASF Coatings develops and markets automotive coatings (for OEM and refinish applications) and surface treatments for various industries. The ACCC determined that:\n\n- there are no horizontal overlaps or vertical relationships between Carlyle's portfolio companies and BASF Coatings in Australia; and\n- while Carlyle has investments in some overseas industrial businesses complementary to BASF Coatings, these have neither operations nor a material customer base in Australia.\n\nThis merger was the first where the ACCC publicly assessed conglomerate issues under the new regime.",
