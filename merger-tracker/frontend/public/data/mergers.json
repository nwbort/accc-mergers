In doing so, the ACCC must have\nregard to the object of the Act and all relevant matters, including the\ninterests of consumers.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotified acquisitions, see the ACCC\u2019s merger assessment guidelines\nand interim merger process guidelines.\nIn conducting its competition assessment, the ACCC has considered\nthe information and documents that were submitted with the\nnotification form as well as further information provided by Molex in\nresponse to a request for information.\nThe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition may be put into\neffect as it considers that the Acquisition is unlikely to have the\neffect of substantially lessening competition in any market in\nAustralia. In reaching its decision, and based on the material before\nit, the ACCC makes the following findings:\n\u2022 Molex and Smiths Interconnect do not appear to compete\nclosely in the supply of connectors in Australia, with the\nproducts supplied by the Parties in Australia used for different\nend-use applications.\n\u2022 the Parties\u2019 market share aggregation in the area of overlap in\nAustralia as a result of the Acquisition is estimated to be very\nlow, and\n\u2022 other companies would continue to supply connectors in\nAustralia, including TE Connectivity, Amphenol and Foxconn."

In doing so, the ACCC must have\nregard to the object of the Act and all relevant matters, including the\ninterests of consumers.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotified acquisitions, see the ACCC\u2019s merger assessment guidelines\nand interim merger process guidelines.\nIn conducting its competition assessment, the ACCC has considered\nthe information and documents that were submitted with the\nnotification form and publicly available information.\nThe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition may be put into\neffect as it considers that the Acquisition is unlikely to have the\neffect of substantially lessening competition in any market. In\nreaching its decision, and based on the material before it, the ACCC\nmakes the following findings.\n\u2022 There is no horizontal overlap between the activities of Danone\nand DSDA.\n\u2022 By increasing Danone\u2019s interest in DSDA from 50% to 51%, the\nproposed Acquisition will increase the degree of control held by\nDanone, and Danone and DSDA will be related bodies corporate\nfor the purposes of the Act. However, given the particular\ngovernance rights already in place between Danone and Saputo\nunder this joint venture arrangement (and the degree of control\nand influence already afforded to Danone), and the fact that\nDanone and DSDA are not competitors in Australia, the ACCC\nconsiders that the proposed Acquisition is unlikely to\nsignificantly alter the nature of the existing relationship between\nDanone and DSDA or have a significant effect on competitive\ndynamics.\n\u2022 The Acquisition does not impact the level of competition that\nDSDA would face in the manufacture and wholesale supply of\nfresh dairy products in Australia."

In particular:\na. Faculty Science has limited operations and presence in\nAustralia.\nb. There is a small horizontal overlap between Accenture and\nFaculty Science in the supply of application implementation\nservices and technology consulting services in Australia.\nc. The parties\u2019 combined market share in the broader supply of\napplication implementation and technology consulting\nservices in Australia is low with alternative suppliers\nexpected to constrain the merged firm.\nd. There is a low risk of concerning conglomerate effects\nresulting from bundling or tying of products post-merger.\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply.\nWhile the ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely\nto be met, given that material competition concerns are unlikely to\narise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not required to\nbe notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition effects\nmore generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on notification\nwaivers and merger assessment guidelines."

In\nparticular:\na. While there is horizontal overlap between the services\nsupplied by Treysta, its connected entities and\nLocumsgroup, the parties\u2019 combined market shares in the\nsupply of financial planning, tax and accounting services in\nSydney and nationally are low and the Acquisition will result\nin a small increment to Treysta and its connected entities\u2019\nmarket shares in the supply of those services.\nb. The market concentration in the supply of financial planning\nand tax and accounting services is low and there are several\nthousand competing suppliers of such services nationally,\nincluding many competing suppliers in Sydney, that are\nexpected to continue to constrain the parties.\nThe ACCC has also had regard to the likelihood that, if the\nAcquisition were put into effect, the notification thresholds\ndetermined under section 51ABP(1) of the Act would apply.\nWhile the ACCC considers that the notification thresholds are likely\nto be met, given the above consideration that material competition\nconcerns are unlikely to arise, the ACCC considers that the\nAcquisition is not required to be notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC\u2019s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC\u2019s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
