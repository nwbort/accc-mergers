In particular:\n• While there is horizontal overlap between Quay and\nAustralian Venue Co, the combined share of the parties in\nthe supply of retail hospitality restaurants in the Circular\nQuay area of Sydney is low.\n• The presence of alternative suppliers of retail hospitality\nrestaurants in proximity to the Circular Quay area of Sydney.\nIn these circumstances, the ACCC does not consider it necessary to\nreach a concluded view on the likelihood of the notification\nthresholds being met. Given that material competition concerns are\nunlikely to arise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is not\nrequired to be notified.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC’s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC’s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."

In particular:\na. The size of the interest in Baseten being acquired by\nBlackbird Ventures is small.\nb. Baseten has a single customer in Australia.\nc. There does not appear to be horizontal overlap between\nBlackbird Ventures’ portfolio companies and Baseten in the\nsupply of AI inference products in Australia.\nd. There appears to be a low risk of foreclosure or other\nconcerning vertical or conglomerate effects resulting from\nexclusionary conduct, bundling or tying of products post-\nacquisition.\nGiven the above considerations that material competition concerns\nare unlikely to arise, the ACCC has determined that the Acquisition is\nnot required to be notified.\nIn these circumstances, the ACCC does not consider it necessary to\nreach a concluded view on the likelihood of the notification\nthresholds being met.\nThe ACCC considers that the determination is consistent with the\nobject of the Act and the interests of consumers in promoting\ncompetition.\nFor more information about the ACCC’s approach to considering\nnotification waiver applications and to assessing competition\neffects more generally, see the ACCC’s interim guidance on\nnotification waivers and merger assessment guidelines."
