In doing so, the ACCC must have\nregard to the object of the Act and all relevant matters, including the\ninterests of consumers.\nFor more information about the ACCC’s approach to considering\nnotified acquisitions, see the ACCC’s merger assessment guidelines\nand interim merger process guidelines.\nIn conducting its competition assessment, the ACCC has considered\nthe information and documents that were submitted with the\nnotification form as well as further information provided by the\nParties following pre-notification engagement with the ACCC.\nThe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition may be put into\neffect as it considers that the Acquisition is unlikely to have the\neffect of substantially lessening competition in any market. In\nreaching its decision, and based on the material before it, the ACCC\nmakes the following findings:\n• The Parties would continue to face competition from\nalternative suppliers of civil contracting and construction\nhaulage services in Queensland, including several\ncompetitors which are of a similar or larger size to the\nParties.\n• The Parties are not close competitors, as the Timms Group\nand L&D Group focus on supplying civil contracting and\nconstruction services within Brisbane, Queensland.
