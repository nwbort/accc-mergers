In\nreaching its decision, and based on the material before it, the ACCC\nmakes the following findings.\n• there is no horizontal overlap between the Parties\n• although the Parties both supply services to Sponsors, the\nAcquisition would be unlikely to give rise to conglomerate\ncompetition concerns. Having regard to the position of the\nParties in their respective markets, the presence of alternative\nsuppliers of both CRO services and digital endpoint collection\nservices, and customer behaviour, the merged entity would be\nunlikely to have the ability or incentive to foreclose other CRO\nproviders or other digital endpoint collection service providers,\nor engage in anti-competitive bundling/tying."

In doing so, the ACCC must have\nregard to the object of the Act and all relevant matters, including the\ninterests of consumers.\nFor more information about the ACCC’s approach to considering\nnotified acquisitions, see the ACCC’s merger assessment guidelines\nand interim merger process guidelines.\nIn conducting its competition assessment, the ACCC has considered\nthe information and documents that were submitted with the\nnotification form and information provided by third parties.\nThe ACCC has determined that the Acquisition may be put into\neffect as it considers that the Acquisition is unlikely to have the\neffect of substantially lessening competition in any market. In\nreaching its decision, and based on the material before it, the ACCC\nmakes the following findings.\n▪ The increase in L'Oréal’s market share of the wholesale supply\nof fragrances in Australia as a result of the Acquisition is\nestimated to be low, including in the wholesale supply of\npremium fragrances.\n▪ The Parties would likely continue face competition from\nalternative wholesale suppliers of fragrances in Australia\nincluding Puig, Coty, InterParfums, Estée Lauder, Revlon,\nShiseido, Chanel, LVMH, Richemont and Hermès International.\n▪ The increase in L’Oreal’s market shares in the wholesale supply\nof each of the ancillary products including scented candles,\nskincare and bath and shower products as a result of the\nAcquisition is very low. To the extent that the parties overlap in\nthe supply of the ancillary products, L’Oreal will also continue to\nface competition from alternative suppliers."
