    "commentary": "The acquisition by KDAu of a lease for land adjacent to Newcastle Airport was the first acquisition cleared by the ACCC under the new regime. The ACCC considered that:\n\n- there is no horizontal competitive overlap between KDAu and the landlord;\n- there are sufficient suitable alternative sites available for KDau's competitors; and\n- the acquisition does not otherwise limit or prevent competition from rivals.\n\nOn that basis, Commissioner Williams determined that the acquisition may be put into effect.",
